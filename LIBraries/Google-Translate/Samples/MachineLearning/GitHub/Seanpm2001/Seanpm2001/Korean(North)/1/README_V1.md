# Why North Korea?

I live in hopes that someday in the future, Korea will unite again. However, North Korea has their own version of the Korean language family, and it should be respected, as we need to be as ready as possible, because due to differences in the South and North variants of the Korean language, there is expected hostility that will occur when Korea reunites. Knowing history, there will be a lot of discrimination from South Koreans against North Koreans, and vice versa.

## Translation not available yet

There currently is no point in making a North Korean translation, as there are 0 GitHub users in NOrth Korea, but I have to keep the opportunity open to when/if it happens.
