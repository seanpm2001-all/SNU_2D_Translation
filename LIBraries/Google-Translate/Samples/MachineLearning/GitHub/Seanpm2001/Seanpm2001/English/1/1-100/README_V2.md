I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020 to get my many projects out there. I am skilled in computer programming, and I have many interests. [Learn more about me here](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/7e40a0e13c066a57577d8200b1afc6a3)

### What I'm currently working on

I have many repositories. The majority of them are sub-projects to a main project (SNU)

My major projects include:

[SNU](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU/) - An advanced website hosting platform, aiming to be the Linux of web development, and an alternate to many sites, including YouTube, Twitter, FaceBook, GitHub, Instagram, Reddit, Discord, and hundreds of thousands more.

[MEDOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS/) - An older project for a set of operating systems that run directly off external mediums, and can be remotely accessed.

[Meadows](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Meadows/) - My dream operating system I have been planning out since 2013: it will be a Quantum computer operating system with every feature you would ever need for computing/

[Journaling](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeanPatrickMyrick2001_LifeStory/) - A project I have that contains a daily journal (planned upload date: May 15th 2040) an audio collection, a set of personal projects, and a set of image repostories. A listing is unavailable as of September 17th 2020.

### What I'm currently learning

It isn't exact, I have many interests. What I am always learning include:

* World history

* Computer Programming and computer history

* The languages of the world

* Virtualization

* Solutions to major world problems

* Pre-history

* Psychology

* Current world problems

* Other (non-culinary)

### What I'm looking to collaborate on

I currently need a technical job. I am willing to work on any ethical computer project, as long as it is written in a language I know well (Python, HTML, Java, JavaScript, CSS, Lisp, Markdown, XML, Shell, or any/all of the ones listed)

Companies I refuse to work for include:

> Google

> Facebook

> Zoom technologies

> Spectrum Enterprise

> Clever

> No other companies currently listed

Companies I am currently considering include:

> Microsoft [::] - I have some family that works here, and I have had a long past with Microsoft (all the way back to 2005) even though I consider some things Microsoft does as unethical, I wouldn't mind working here (I have a very strong personal experience with Microsoft products, notably Windows XP) If there are any jobs here that use Python, I can do them.

> VideoLan /-\ - I would like to try and write documentation for VideoLan, I am very good at writing documentation, as I enjoy doing it, and I do it most of the day, every day. Currently, VideoLan is unable to have documentation writers due to low amounts of volunteers. If allowed, I will write documentation for every version of VLC that doesn't have it (only in English, I can't do other languages)

> Canonical (&) - I would like to try and contribute to Linux in any way I can. Working at Canonical is currently an option, I don't know exactly what I would do here, but I could hopefully do something.

> The KDE Foundation (K) - KDE would be a nice foundation to work for. I really love their super lightweight open source projects, and I could help reduce even more bloat. If a job is available in a language I have at least 40% knowledge in, I could work here.

> Khan Academy (^) - I would like to help contribute to Khan Academy, I have used the site for nearly 4 years straight on a daily basis. If it would be possible to make videos and articles for them, I have always considered starting a course on virtualization.

> The GNOME organization (G) - if possible, I could try and set some changes to reduce the huge memory usage of GNOME, that has always stuck out as something that needs to be fixed to me. It is still a lot better than Windows 10s memory usage, idle on Windows 10 would use half my RAM, no matter how much I had (4, 8, 16 GB) on my first Linux laptop, it has always stayed below 1.8 gigabytes when idle (also counting the system monitor)

> No other companies currently listed

### What I'm looking to help with

I will do free technical support for you, or programming related work in my scope of knowledge. I do this on my own time, so I can only help a certain amount of people a day. Before trying to ask for my technical support, try the following to troubleshoot:

> `CTRL` + `Z` - Undoes your last mistake

> Restart your computer

I charge money for technical support ($5.00 per hour) if I have to do these steps more than 3 times in a year for 1 person.

### Ask me about

Technology, farming, life, language, other.

### How to reach me

I have multiple methods of being reached. Currently, I can't answer to phone calls or text messages, as my phones SIM card randomly got corrupted. Here are some ways you can message me:

* Through GitHub (Comment on my most recently edited project, be careful of the exact time, if not, I should eventually get to your message)

* Through Discord (server link: [Click here](https://discord.gg/CcFpEDQ))

* Through Reddit (subreddit link: [Click here r/seanpm2001](https://www.reddit.com/r/seanpm2001/) or through direct message [Click here to view my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/seanwallawalla/)

There currently aren't any other ways of messaging me
