I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020 to get my many projects out there. I am skilled in computer programming, and I have many interests. [Learn more about me here](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/7e40a0e13c066a57577d8200b1afc6a3)

### What I'm currently working on

I have many repositories. The majority of them are sub-projects to a main project (SNU)

My major projects include:

[SNU](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU/) - An advanced website hosting platform, aiming to be the Linux of web development, and an alternate to many sites, including YouTube, Twitter, FaceBook, GitHub, Instagram, Reddit, Discord, and hundreds of thousands more.

[MEDOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS/) - An older project for a set of operating systems that run directly off external mediums, and can be remotely accessed.

[Meadows](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Meadows/) - My dream operating system I have been planning out since 2013: it will be a Quantum computer operating system with every feature you would ever need for computing/

[Journaling](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeanPatrickMyrick2001_LifeStory/) - A project I have that contains a daily journal (planned upload date: May 15th 2040) an audio collection, a set of personal projects, and a set of image repostories. A listing is unavailable as of September 17th 2020.

## Free software isn't free to develop

Remember that free software and open source software is not always free to develop. Make sure to donate to software organizations you like, so that they can keep producing contributions to society.

My list of supported organizations include:

* Wikimedia (creators of Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and more)

* VideoLan (creators of VLC Media Player and other prominent video tools)

* GNU

* The Free Software Foundation

* The Open Document foundation

* Khan Academy

* The Linux foundation

* FFMPEG

* The Internet Archive (also the creators of the wayback machine)

* Open Street Map

* Inkscape

* Mozilla (moz://a)

**More to be listed**

***

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

### What I'm currently learning

It isn't exact, I have many interests. What I am always learning include:

* World history

* Computer Programming and computer history

* The languages of the world

* Virtualization

* Solutions to major world problems

* Pre-history

* Psychology

* Current world problems

* Other (non-culinary)

***

### What I'm looking to collaborate on

I currently need a technical job. I am willing to work on any ethical computer project, as long as it is written in a language I know well (Python, HTML, Java, JavaScript, CSS, Lisp, Markdown, XML, Shell, or any/all of the ones listed)

Companies I refuse to work for include:

> Google

> Facebook

> Zoom technologies

> Spectrum Enterprise

> Clever

> No other companies currently listed

Companies I am currently considering include:

> Microsoft [::] - I have some family that works here, and I have had a long past with Microsoft (all the way back to 2005) even though I consider some things Microsoft does as unethical, I wouldn't mind working here (I have a very strong personal experience with Microsoft products, notably Windows XP) If there are any jobs here that use Python, I can do them.

> VideoLan /-\ - I would like to try and write documentation for VideoLan, I am very good at writing documentation, as I enjoy doing it, and I do it most of the day, every day. Currently, VideoLan is unable to have documentation writers due to low amounts of volunteers. If allowed, I will write documentation for every version of VLC that doesn't have it (only in English, I can't do other languages)

> Canonical (&) - I would like to try and contribute to Linux in any way I can. Working at Canonical is currently an option, I don't know exactly what I would do here, but I could hopefully do something.

> The KDE Foundation (K) - KDE would be a nice foundation to work for. I really love their super lightweight open source projects, and I could help reduce even more bloat. If a job is available in a language I have at least 40% knowledge in, I could work here.

> Khan Academy (^) - I would like to help contribute to Khan Academy, I have used the site for nearly 4 years straight on a daily basis. If it would be possible to make videos and articles for them, I have always considered starting a course on virtualization.

> The GNOME organization (G) - if possible, I could try and set some changes to reduce the huge memory usage of GNOME, that has always stuck out as something that needs to be fixed to me. It is still a lot better than Windows 10s memory usage, idle on Windows 10 would use half my RAM, no matter how much I had (4, 8, 16 GB) on my first Linux laptop, it has always stayed below 1.8 gigabytes when idle (also counting the system monitor)

> No other companies currently listed

### What I'm looking to help with

I will do free technical support for you, or programming related work in my scope of knowledge. I do this on my own time, so I can only help a certain amount of people a day. Before trying to ask for my technical support, try the following to troubleshoot:

> `CTRL` + `Z` - Undoes your last mistake

> Restart your computer

I charge money for technical support ($5.00 per hour) if I have to do these steps more than 3 times in a year for 1 person.

**Some limitations**

I cannot do projects unless the scripts are on GitHub or SourceForge already.

I also can't work on projects that are related to your school work. Please do not ask me to do your school work for you. We could both get in trouble for this.

I would prefer to help with projects written in Python 3, Markdown, HTML5, CSS3, Java, C, C++, or JavaScript. I won't be able to help as well with projects written in other languages.

No other limitations listed at the moment.

### Feature requests for GitHub

There are some features that would be nice for GitHub. They include:

**Entries marked with `⭐` are highest priority**

> * The ability to follow organizations ⭐

> * An increased file upload size (25 MB > 50 MB or higher) so that larger files can be uploaded, including maximum size Scratch 1, 2, and 3 projects ⭐

> * A built-in dark mode, along with other modes (if needed)

> * Adding back the ability to hover over and see commit percentages ⭐

> * Support for Go! (2004 language by Francis McCabe) (to distinguish from Go (2009 Google language))

> * No other requests at the moment

### Ask me about

Technology, farming, life, language, other.

### How to reach me

I have multiple methods of being reached. Currently, I can't answer to phone calls or text messages, as my phones SIM card randomly got corrupted. Here are some ways you can message me:

* Through GitHub (Comment on my most recently edited project, be careful of the exact time, if not, I should eventually get to your message)

* Through Discord (server link: [Click here](https://discord.gg/CcFpEDQ))

* Through Reddit (subreddit link: [Click here r/seanpm2001](https://www.reddit.com/r/seanpm2001/) or through direct message [Click here to view my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/seanwallawalla/) - currently inactive on the subreddit, but I will likely respond to a reply or DM within 48 hours

There currently aren't any other ways of messaging me

### Projects on other platforms

I have been using GitHub for software development since May 25th 2020, but I have been programming since early 2016.

On December 21st 2020, I created accounts on SourceForge, GitLab, and BitBucket. I currently don't maintain any projects there at the moment, GitHub still is the powerhouse.

[SourceForge link](https://sourceforge.net/u/seanpm2001/profile/)

[GitLab link](https://gitlab.com/seanpm2001)

[BitBucket link](https://bitbucket.org/seanpm2001/)

When I joined GitHub, I also intended to use other platforms as well, as something could always go wrong with my account or GitHub itself, and it isn't smart to rely on a single source for everything.

Now, if GitHub is having problems or if you have problems with GitHub, my projects are viewable on 3 other platforms. Unfortunately, they are still only on GitHub, as I don't have enough developers to manage 4 platforms at once, I will eventually mirror my projects over.
