I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020 to get my many projects out there. I am skilled in computer programming, and I have many interests. [Learn more about me here](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/7e40a0e13c066a57577d8200b1afc6a3)

### What I'm currently working on

I have many repositories. The majority of them are sub-projects to a main project (SNU)

My major projects include:

[SNU](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU/) - An advanced website hosting platform, aiming to be the Linux of web development, and an alternate to many sites, including YouTube, Twitter, FaceBook, GitHub, Instagram, Reddit, Discord, and hundreds of thousands more.

[MEDOS](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS/) - An older project for a set of operating systems that run directly off external mediums, and can be remotely accessed.

[Meadows](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Meadows/) - My dream operating system I have been planning out since 2013: it will be a Quantum computer operating system with every feature you would ever need for computing/

### How to reach me

I have multiple methods of being reached. Currently, I can't answer to phone calls or text messages, as my phones SIM card randomly got corrupted. Here are some ways you can message me:

* Through GitHub (Comment on my most recently edited project, be careful of the exact time, if not, I should eventually get to your message)

* Through Discord (server link: [Click here](https://discord.gg/CcFpEDQ))

* Through Reddit (subreddit link: [Click here r/seanpm2001](https://www.reddit.com/r/seanpm2001/) or through direct message [Click here to view my profile](https://www.reddit.com/user/seanwallawalla/)

There currently aren't any other ways of messaging me
