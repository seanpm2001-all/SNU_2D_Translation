# New feature idea

**From:** `April 3rd 2021`

**Published:** `April 4th 2021`

**Description:** _A joke translation option that translates into Piglatin (Igpay Atinlay) a language game/argot_

## How it works:

English words are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable to create such a suffix. For example, "Wikipedia" would become "Ikipediaway" (the "W" is moved from the beginning and has "ay" appended to create a suffix). The objective is to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot, cant, or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin)
