# New ideas for SNU 2D Translation

## From March 11th 2021

1. Laymans terms translator - Translates terms into Laymans terms, translates words and phrases into a simplified easy to read form (not a very good example of Laymans terms)

2. Emojifier translation (adds Emojis before and after words, level of emojis and replacements can be adjusted, separate option to replace the words themselves with Emojis

3. Hepburner (Hepburn Romanization translation) example: Hepburn romanization (Japanese: ヘボン式ローマ字, Hepburn: Hebon-shiki rōmaji)

4. Reverser (`Reverses text:`|`: txet sesreveR`)

5. Forwarder (reverse of reverser, need a better name) so `sesreveR` turns back into `Reverse`

6. Numberfier (replaces letters with numbers and other mathematical symbols across all languages) for example: A becomes ? B becomes 8 C Becomes ( D becomes ? E becomes 3, etc. very childish feature

7. RomeMMMMMMMMMCCCXXXLVIIII (name will be changed, name suggestions will be taken, this one is obviously too long and too crazy) Romanizes/deromanizes numbers, 42 becomes LII, LII becomes 42, etc.

8. Reverse rl - makes right to left languages (like Arabic) compile in left to right form (which might make it unreadable)

9. Reverse lr - Reverse of above, makes left to right languages (like English) compile in right to left form (which might make it unreadable)

10. Reverse ud/du - Makes up to down languages (like Mongolian) read in left to right or right to left (which might make it unreadable)

These were the 10 new ideas I came up with last night. Most of them are joke features.
